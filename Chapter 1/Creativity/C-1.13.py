## Method 1
# Function reverses a list of n integers
# 	Pass in the list of integer
# 	Slice the integer with an interval of -1 starting from the end and then
# assign to the just created variable
# 	Return Slice
# End Function


## Method 2
# Function reverses a list of n integers
# 	Pass in the list of integers
# 	Create a variable to count for the storage variable
# 	Loop though the list starting from the back with a step of -1 and assign to
# temp variable using magnitude of the step as  index
# 	Return answer
