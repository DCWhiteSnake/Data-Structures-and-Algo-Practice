Potential Disadvantages of Having Deep Inheritance trees:
   1. It can lower the ability of a developer to efficiently manage the code.
   
   2. More complex design
   
   3. Classes are more likely to exibit defects during testing when they are
       deeper in the inheritance tree
   
   4. Understanding of a single line may require tracing  a chain of method               invocations through several different object classes and  up and down the        object hierarchy to find where the work is really getting done.
