Given that an arithmetic progression adds a fixed constant to one term of the progression to produce the next, this sounds just like the range class in a way, so we can use the formular given  range class  for finding the maximum number of steps i.e., given start, stop and step:
    max(0, (stop - start + step -1)//step)

so given that;
start = 0
stop = 2 ^63
step = 128

max(0, (math.pow(2, 63)  + 127)//128)

Which give the answer:
7.205759403792794e+16
